Question? 
    How to select the valuable place when travel to the NYC?

Goal: 
    Applied the Apache Airflow directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to build data pipelines on NYC open data (park, shooting, hot_spot, hotel, public housing) and Airbnb housing data, followed by data minipulation, analysis, and visualization.
